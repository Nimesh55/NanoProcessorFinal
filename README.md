# NanoProcessorFinal

We were asked to design a 4-bit Nanoprocessor which is capable of executing 4 instructions add, 
subtract, jump and negation.

This designed processor can ,
● Add and subtract signed integers
● Decode instructions to activate necessary components on the processor
● Be verified their functionality via simulation and on the development board

Since this was a team project, our team consisted of 3 members; Yasith, Nimesh and Sathira. As 
a group, we wanted to address key points which we learnt in the lectures and previous labs. Since 
we cannot meet physically due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we utilized zoom meetings to get to 
know each other. In the first meeting on 26 March 2021, we threw out ideas on what we were 
thinking regarding the project and split up who was going to cover which aspects of the project. 
Five days before the due date, we completed all the tasks which were assigned and started to 
design the Nanoprocessor using previously designed components.
Overall, we think our project was a huge success. We achieved our goal of achieving the key 
aspects of the microprocessor and did so in a fun and interactive way.
